# Ideabox Group Project


## Overview of project and goals
Our goal was to have a better understanding of how css/html interact with JavaScript with flex as well as localStorage. We created an application to allow users to enter ideas with a title and body and save them to a display section.
## Overview of technologies used, challenges, and wins, any other reflections
We used JavaScript, flex, media queries, filter, ternary, constructor, added methods to classes. Challenges: CSS and HTML trying to get the elements just right, localStorage. Wins: localStorage and flex, we have a much better understanding of how they work.
